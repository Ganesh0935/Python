Q1. What is Statistics? 
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides methods for making informed decisions and drawing conclusions from data by using various techniques, tools, and concepts.

Q2. Different Types of Statistics and Examples:

Descriptive Statistics: These are used to describe and summarize data. Examples include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, standard deviation).
Inferential Statistics: These are used to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. Examples include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
Q3. Different Types of Data:

Qualitative (Categorical) Data: This type of data represents qualities or categories and cannot be measured numerically. Examples include gender, color, and occupation.
Quantitative Data: This type of data is numerical and represents quantities that can be measured. Examples include height, age, and income.
Now, let's categorize the provided datasets:

(i) Grading in exam: Qualitative (Categorical) data (ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative (Categorical) data (iii) Height data of a class: Quantitative (Continuous) data (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: Quantitative (Discrete) data

Q5. Levels of Measurement and Examples:

Nominal: This level involves categories without any inherent order. Examples include eye color, gender, or car brands.
Ordinal: This level has categories with a meaningful order, but the differences between the categories are not consistent. Examples include education levels (e.g., elementary, high school, college) or star ratings (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars).
Q6. Importance of Understanding Level of Measurement: Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it dictates which statistical methods can be appropriately applied. For example, you can't calculate a meaningful mean for nominal data like eye color, but you can for ordinal data like education levels.

Q7. Difference between Nominal and Ordinal Data: Nominal data has categories without any inherent order, while ordinal data has categories with a meaningful order but inconsistent differences between them. For example, gender (male, female) is nominal, while education levels (elementary, high school, college) are ordinal.

Q8. Plot to Display Data in Terms of Range: A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used to display data in terms of its range. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers of a dataset.

Q9. Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics:

Descriptive Statistics: These provide a summary of data without making any generalizations about a larger population. For example, calculating the mean height of a group of students.
Inferential Statistics: These involve making predictions or drawing conclusions about a larger population based on a sample. For instance, using a sample of voters to predict election outcomes for an entire country.
Q10. Measures of Central Tendency and Variability:

Measures of Central Tendency: These describe the central or typical value of a dataset.

Mean: Average value of data points.
Median: Middle value when data is ordered.
Mode: Most frequently occurring value.
Measures of Variability: These describe the spread or dispersion of data points.

Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Standard Deviation: Average distance of data points from the mean.
Variance: Average of the squared differences from the mean.
